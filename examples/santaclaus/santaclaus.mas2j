/*
Santa Claus Project
-------------------
Santa repeatedly sleeps until wakened by either all of his nine reindeer, back from their holidays,
or by a group of three of his ten elves. If awakened by the reindeer, he harnesses each of them to
his sleight, delivers toys with them, and finally unharnesses them (allowing them to go off on
holiday). If awakened by a group of elves, he shows each of the group into his study, consults with
them on toy R&D, and finally shows them each out (allowing them to go back to work). Santa should
give priority to the reindeer in the case that there is both a group of elves and a group of
reindeer waiting. See description at: http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/santa/.
